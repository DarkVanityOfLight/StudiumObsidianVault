## Questions

- Task 3: When doing it my way: Each Forall branch can choose a different transition on the next state
- Task 3: When doing it per direct scanning TM, we can not stop after $n$ transitions but only after $2^n$ which kills our runtime.
- Task 2: Can't we assert the size of our Universe per constants? -> Thus Spoiler can win because the other universe is simply to small to represent all constants?
