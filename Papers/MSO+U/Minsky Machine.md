> > By a Minsky machine we mean a (possibly nondeterministic) device which has a finite state space, and two counters that can be incremented, decremented, and tested for zero. It is undecidable whether a given Minsky machine has an accepting run, i.e. one which begins in a designated initial state with zero on both counters, and ends in a designated final state.
