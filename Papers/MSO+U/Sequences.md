## Number Sequence
[Number Sequence](MSO+U.pdf#page=2&selection=159,0,168,0&color=red)
An element of $\mathbb N^{\omega}$

## Vector Sequence
[Vector Sequence](MSO+U.pdf#page=2&selection=168,6,183,0&color=red)
An element of $(\mathbb N^*)^{\omega}$, that is an infinite sequence of vectors of natural numbers of possibly different dimensions.


## Number sequences in vector sequences
[Number sequences in vector sequences](MSO+U.pdf#page=2&selection=207,27,232,0&color=red)
Let $f$ be a number sequence and $\textbf{f}$ a vector sequence, we write
$f\in\textbf{f}$ if for every position $i$ the $i$-th number in the sequence $f$ appears in the $i$-th vector in the vector sequence $\textbf{f}$

### Dimension
[Dimension](MSO+U.pdf#page=2&selection=324,3,333,1&color=red)
In a vector sequence of dimension $d$ all vectors have dimension $d$.
