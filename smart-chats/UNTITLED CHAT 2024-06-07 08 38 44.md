Where in my notes can I find info about real linear arithmetic aka the theory $\mathbb R; <, +, 0, 1$

##### assistant
Based on your notes, you can find information about real linear arithmetic, also known as the theory $(\mathbb R; <, +, 0, 1)$, in the following note:
- [[Logik/Expressive Power of Linear Arithmetic.md]]
In this note, you will find a discussion about definable integer relations and real linear arithmetic. Real linear arithmetic is an extension of linear arithmetic over the integers to the reals.

Explain Branch and bound to me

##### assistant
Branch and Bound (B&B) is a popular algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems, specifically those that can be modeled as a search in a tree-like structure. It combines the ideas of branching, where the search space is divided into smaller subspaces, and bounding, where upper and lower bounds are estimated for the optimal solution in each subspace.

The main idea is to explore the search space systematically, starting from the root node, and at each step, make a decision (branch) that splits the current node into several child nodes. For each child node, an estimate (bound) is computed for the optimal solution value in that subspace. If the bound for a child node is worse than the current best solution found so far, the child node is pruned (ignored) and not further explored. This pruning process helps to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, making the algorithm more efficient.

The B&B algorithm can be applied to various types of optimization problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum of a function, or finding the shortest path in a graph. It is widely used in operations research, computer science, and engineering to solve complex optimization problems.

Here's a high-level description of the B&B algorithm:

1. Initialize the current node as the root node, and set the best solution found so far to a value with an infinite cost (or any other large value).
2. For the current node, compute a lower bound on the optimal solution value in the subspace represented by the node.
3. If the lower bound for the current node is greater than or equal to the best solution found so far, update the best solution found and move to the next node (if any).
4. Otherwise, branch the current node by making a decision that splits the node into several child nodes. For each child node, compute an upper bound on the optimal solution value in the subspace represented by the child node.
5. If the upper bound for a child node is less than the lower bound for the parent node, prune the child node and move to the next node (if any).
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each child node until all child nodes have been explored or pruned.
7. If there are no more nodes to explore, return the best solution found.

The efficiency of the B&B algorithm depends on the quality of the bounds computed for each node, as well as the branching strategy used to divide the search space. A good branching strategy should aim to divide the search space in a way that reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, while still maintaining a good balance between exploring promising subspaces and pruning unpromising ones.
