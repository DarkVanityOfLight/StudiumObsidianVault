Tell me a file in Math or Logik that I should rewrite or resturcutre

##### assistant
Based on your notes, it seems that you have written down various mathematical concepts and their explanations, including quadratic functions, series, multivariate analysis, propositional logic, and DPLL(T) algorithm.
To rewrite or restructure these notes, I would suggest the following:
1. Organize the notes by topic, grouping similar concepts together. For example, all the notes related to quadratic functions could be placed in a section called "Quadratic Functions," while the notes about series could be grouped under "Series."
2. Use consistent formatting for definitions, examples, and proofs. For example, you could use a specific font for definitions, a specific font for examples, and a specific font for proofs.
3. Include clear and concise headings for each section, so that readers can easily navigate the document.
4. Use mathematical notation consistently, and make sure to define any symbols used in the notes.
5. Include exercises or problems at the end of each section, to help readers practice the concepts learned.
6. Consider adding visual aids, such as diagrams or graphs, to help illustrate the concepts.
7. Make sure to proofread the notes carefully, to ensure that they are free of errors and easy to understand.
Overall, the goal should be to create a clear and organized document that is easy for readers to understand and use as a reference.

What normal forms do I know
