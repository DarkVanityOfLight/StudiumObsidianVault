In our definition of [regular](Regular%20Games.md) [games](Game.md), the automation for $\text{Win}$ reads vertices.

In some cases it is useful to abstract away information of the vertices that is not relevant for $\text{Win}$. We then allow the automaton for $\text{Win}$ to only read the relevant information, called __atomic propositions__, allowing the automaton to be more succinct.
