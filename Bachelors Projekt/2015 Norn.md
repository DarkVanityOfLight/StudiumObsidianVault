## Summary
This paper presents a a new decision procedure for string logic.

It is sound for the general logic, and a decision procedure for a particulary rich fragment that restricts the form of word equations.

Existing procedures often make assumptions on the maximum length of words.

The procedure(and an implementation of it) work on programms encoded as Horn clauses.
## Categories
- word (dis)equalities such as $(a \cdot u = v \cdot b)$ or $(a \cdot u \not = v \cdot b)$, where $a, b$ are letters and $u, v$ are string variables denoting words of arbitrary lengths
-  length constraints such as $(|u| = |v| + 1)$, where $|u|$ refers to the length of the word denoted by string variable $u$,
-  predicates representing membership in regular expressions, e.g., $u \in c · (a + b)^*$
