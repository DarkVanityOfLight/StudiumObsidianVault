## Summary
The paper addresses the satisfiability problem in a logic that combines word equations, regular languages, and Presburger constraints on string lengths. 

New decision procedure for Quadratic Word equations and Quadratic Word Equations with regular membership.

The approach reduces the problem to Presburger arithmetic and includes two key components: 
1. An algorithm to derive all solutions for conjunctions of word equations and regular expressions, 
2. Methods to compute precise constraints on string lengths.
