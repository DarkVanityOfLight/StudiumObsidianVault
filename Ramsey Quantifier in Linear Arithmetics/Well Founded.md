A [Relation](Relation.md) that does not allow infinite descending chains.

> A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is well-founded if every non empty subset of $A$ has a minimal element with respect to $R$

If a [Relation](Relation.md) $R$ is transitive, then $R$ is __well-founded__ iff there is no $R$-loop and no infinite $R$-clique
