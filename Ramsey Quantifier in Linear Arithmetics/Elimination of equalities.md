## Proof
### Infinite clique => AP

Assume there is an infinite Ramsey clique $S = \lbrace x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\rbrace$ where every pair $(x_i ​,x_j​)$ with $i<j$ satisfies
$$\phi = r \cdot x_i = s \cdot x_j + C.$$
With $r$ and $s$ being fixed $d$ dimensional vectors and $C$ is a constant. We show the existence of two integer vectors $v \not = 0, w$ satisfying $r\cdot v = 0 \land s\cdot v = 0 \land r\cdot w = s\cdot w + C$.


Define the difference set
$$D = \lbrace y - x : x, y \in S\rbrace \subseteq \mathbb Z^d$$
Since $\mathbb Z^d$ is a [finitely generated abelian group](Vectors%20of%20integers%20are%20finitely%20generated%20abelian%20groups.md) every subgroup of $\mathbb Z^d$ is finitely generated #citation_needed.

Let $H = \langle D \rangle$ be the subgroup generated by $D$. Then $H$ is a free abelian subgroup of rank $k\le d$. Because $S$ is infinite, $H$ has positive rank $k\ge 1$. #citation_needed 

Since $H$ is free abelian, it has a basis. Let $v\in D$ be a primitive vector in $H$. #citation_needed 

By definition of $D$, there are infinitely many pairs $(x_i, y_i)\in S\times S$ such that $y_i -x_i = v$.
Picking any such pair and substituting $y = x+ v$ into $\phi$  gives:
$$\begin{align}
&r \cdot x = s \cdot y + C\\
&r\cdot x = s\cdot(x + v) + C \implies r \cdot x = sx + sv + C\\
\iff&(r-s) \cdot x = s\cdot v + C
\end{align}$$

For any two solutions $x_i, x_j$, substracting their equations yields
$$(r-s) \cdot (x_i -x_j) = 0$$
$x_i - x_j$ is in turn itself a a difference of two points in $S$ and hence lies in $D$. In particular $v$ as a difference of two points fullfills this and 
$$(r-s) \cdot v = 0 \iff r\cdot v =  s\cdot v$$

Now let $K = r \cdot v = s\cdot v$. If we build an AP $w + n v$,then for any $i < j$.
Inserting into the left and right side of the equation
$$\begin{align}
r \cdot (w + iv) \iff r \cdot w + i K, \qquad
s \cdot (w + jv) + C \iff s\cdot w + jK + C
\end{align}$$
So to fullfill
$$\begin{align}
r \cdot (w + iv) = s \cdot (w + jv) + C \quad \forall i < j
\end{align}$$
we need
$$
r\cdot w + iK = s \cdot w + jK + C \implies r\cdot w - s \cdot w = C + K(j-i)
$$
to be independent of $i < j$. But since $i, j$ are arbitrary integers the only way to fullfill this is
$$K = 0 \implies r\cdot v = 0, s\cdot v = 0$$

Finally we can pick any point $w\in S$. Then $(w, w+v)$ lies in the clique ($w+v \in S$ by closure of $D$), so
$$r \cdot w = s \cdot (w+v) + C = s \cdot w + 0 + C \implies r \cdot w = s \cdot w + C$$

We have shown how to construct a $v \not = 0$ with $r \cdot v = s\cdot v = 0$, and $w$ with $r \cdot w =  s\cdot w + C$.

Interpreting these as the parameters of our arithmetic progression we can construct
$$\lbrace w + n v |  n \in \mathbb Z\rbrace$$
which is an infinite subset of $S$ and for every $i < j$ it satisfies that
$$r \cdot (w + iv) = r\cdot w = s\cdot w+C = s\cdot (w + jv) + C$$
and thus it is an infinite Ramsey clique and the witnesses $v, w$ give a Presburger definable AP progression eliminating the Ramsey Quantifier.


### AP => Ramsey Clique
Assume we are given the witnesses $v, w$ for
$$r \cdot v = 0 \land s \cdot v =0 \land r \cdot w = s \cdot w + C \land v \not = 0$$
Then the Arithmetic progression
$$a = \lbrace w + nv | n \in\mathbb Z\rbrace$$
can be interpreted as the witnesses for the clique witnessing
$$\exists^{ram} \textbf{x}, \textbf{y} : \varphi(x, y, c)$$


First observe that the AP produces __distinct__ elements that is
$$a_i \not = a_j\quad i< j$$
because per assumption $v \not = 0$.

Next we show that every pair of elements of the sequence
 $x = w + iv$ and $y = w + jv$ for any two $i < j$, satisfies the equation.
$$\begin{align}
&rx = sy + C\\
\iff& r (w + iv) = s (w + jv) + C\\
\iff&rw + rvi = sw + svj +C\\
&\text{Since $rv = sv = 0$}\\
\iff& rw = sw +C\\
\end{align}$$
which holds exactly per our assumptions.
