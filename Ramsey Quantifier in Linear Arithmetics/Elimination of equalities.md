## Proof
### Infinite clique => AP

Suppose we have an infinite set
$$S = \lbrace x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\rbrace \subseteq \mathbb Z^d$$
and two fixed vectors $r, s\in \mathbb Z^d$ and some constant $C = t^\top z + h$. We assume that every ordered pair $(x_i, x_j)$ with $i < j$ satisfies the clique condition:
$$r^\top x_i = s^\top x_j + C$$
Our goal is to find integer vectors $v\not = 0, w$ such that
$$r^\top v = 0\qquad s^\top v = 0\qquad r^\top w = s^\top w + C$$
These vectors will witness the infinite AP
$$\lbrace w + nv : n \in \mathbb Z\rbrace$$
contained in $S$.


Consider the set of all differences
$$D = \lbrace y -x : x, y \in S\rbrace \subseteq \mathbb Z^d$$
Since $S$ is infinite, $D$ is infinite. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $\mathbb Z^d$ generated by $D$. As a free abelian group of rank at least $1$, $H$ has a finite basis.

Because $H$ is finitely generated but $D$ is infinite, some nonzero vector $v \in D$ must occur infinitely as a difference between elements of $S$. In other words, there are infinitely many $x\in S$ with $x + v \in S$.

For any such $x$, plugging in $y = x+v$ into the clique equation gives
$$r^\top x = s^\top (x+v) + C \quad\Longrightarrow\quad (r-s)^\top x = s^\top v + C.$$
If we repeat this for two different solutions $x, x'$, and then subtracting yields
$$(r-s)^\top (x - x') = 0.$$
But $x - x' \in D$, and in particular we can choose $x - x' =v$. Hence
$$(r-s)^\top v = 0 \implies r^\top v = s^\top v$$
Let $K := r^\top v = s^\top v$.
When constructing our AP $w+nv$, for any $i< j$, we need
$$r^\top (w + iv) = s^\top (w + jv) + C.$$
Expanding both sides:
$$r^\top w + iK = s^\top w + jk + C$$
Because $i, j$ can be arbitrarily far apart, the only way for this to hold is to have $K = 0$. Thus
$$r^\top v = 0\qquad s^\top v = 0$$
Since there are infinitely many $x\in S$ with $x+v \in S$, pick any such $w\in S$. Then $(w, w+v)$ lies in the clique, so 
$$r^\top w = s^\top (w+v) + C = s^\top w + 0+ C.$$
Rearranging gives
$$r^\top w = s^\top w +C.$$

We have constructed
- A nonzero vector $v$ with $r^\top v= s^\top v = 0$
- A vector $w$ with $r^\top w = s^\top w + C$

And thus the infinite arithmetic progression
$$\lbrace w + nv | n\in\mathbb Z\rbrace$$
is contained in $S$.
### AP => Ramsey Clique
Assume we are given the witnesses $v, w$ for
$$r \cdot v = 0 \land s \cdot v =0 \land r \cdot w = s \cdot w + C \land v \not = 0$$
Then the Arithmetic progression
$$a = \lbrace w + nv | n \in\mathbb Z\rbrace$$
can be interpreted as the witnesses for the clique witnessing
$$\exists^{ram} \textbf{x}, \textbf{y} : \varphi(x, y, c)$$

First observe that the AP produces distinct elements that is
$$a_i \not = a_j\quad i< j$$
because per assumption $v \not = 0$.

Next we show that every pair of elements of the sequence
 $x = w + iv$ and $y = w + jv$ for any two $i < j$, satisfies the equation.
$$\begin{align}
&rx = sy + C\\
\iff& r (w + iv) = s (w + jv) + C\\
\iff&rw + rvi = sw + svj +C\\
&\text{Since $rv = sv = 0$}\\
\iff& rw = sw +C\\
\end{align}$$
which holds exactly per our assumptions.
