The formula 
$$\exists^\text{ram} x, y : \varphi(x, y, z)$$
is fulfilled by valuation $c$ of free variables $z$ iff there exists $(a_i)_{i\ge 1}$ of pairwise distinct valuations such that $\varphi(a_i, a_j, c)$ for all $i < j$.[Ramsey Quantifiers in Linear Arithmetics, p.9](Ramsey%20Quantifiers%20in%20Linear%20Arithmetics.pdf#page=9&selection=49,0,93,1&color=red)
Such a sequence is called an infinite clique.
