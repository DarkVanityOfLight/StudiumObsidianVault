The **domain** (or **domain of discourse**, sometimes just the **universe**) is the [Set](Mengen.md) of objects that our logical language talks about. 

## What Is a Domain?

- In [[Model Theory]], a structure is a pair , where:
    - is a non-empty set called the **domain**.
    - is an interpretation mapping symbols to elements, relations, and functions over .
- The domain specifies **what** your variables range over and **where** functions and predicates get their inputs from.

## Why the Domain Matters
1. **Semantics**: Truth of formulas depends on evaluating them relative to a domain and an interpretation.
2. **Scope**: A different domain means a different “universe” — what’s true in one model might be false in another.
3. **Quantifiers**: “For all x” ($\forall x$) or “there exists x” ($\exists x$) always quantify over the domain .
