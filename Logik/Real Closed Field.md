>[!THEOREM]
>The [theory](Theorien%20der%20ersten%20Stufe.md) over $Th(\mathbb R; +, \times, <, =, 0, 1)$ is deciable.

This is often called _nonlinear real arithmetic_.

The decidability was initially proven using a [quantifier elimination](Quantorenelemination.md) method with nonelementary complexity.
